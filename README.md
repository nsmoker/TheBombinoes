#TheBombinoes

Small tetris clone I created with SDL2. This is a rewrite of my original version. It's extremely similar, but the code is much cleaner. Audio, menus, and a high score screen were in the original and will be in this version very soon. 

The font for the scores (which will also be used for the menus) is m5x7 by Daniel Linssen.
